## packages package

HL7 Support for Atom.  Adapted from Sublime Text package.

## But I helped too!

Much of this already existed however it wasn't in the Atom registry and me and
my team wanted some additional pieces such as easy to spot missing line breaks
after a PID segment, an easy to spot Patient Identifier, etc.

It also wasn't in the Atom Registry so one would have to clone to desktop and
move it over to ~/.atom/packages

If there is something missing that YOU want to see feel free to let me know
I'll work on it when I can - you're also free to add it yourself!
